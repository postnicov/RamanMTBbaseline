The MATLAB code used for processing of SERS spectra of individual micobacteria. For the operation (the main script is 'baselineMTB.m'), functions from the ['Raman Spectrum Baseline Removal']([https://duckduckgo.com](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69649-raman-spectrum-baseline-removal)) by Ayad Al-Rumaithi should also downloaded to the folder with the code and data. The folder 'src' contains some examples of raw data.
